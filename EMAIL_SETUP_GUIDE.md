# Email Setup Guide for ShopHub

## Current Status
‚ùå **Emails are currently simulated only** - customers will NOT receive real emails when placing orders.

## How to Enable Real Email Notifications

### Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended - Easy Setup)

EmailJS allows you to send emails directly from your website without a backend server.

#### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/month)
3. Verify your email

#### Step 2: Connect Email Service
1. In EmailJS dashboard, click **"Email Services"**
2. Click **"Add New Service"**
3. Choose your email provider:
   - **Gmail** (easiest)
   - **Outlook/Hotmail**
   - **Yahoo**
   - Or any SMTP service
4. Follow the connection steps

#### Step 3: Create Email Template
1. Go to **"Email Templates"**
2. Click **"Create New Template"**
3. Use this template:

```html
Subject: Order Confirmation - {{order_number}}

Dear {{customer_name}},

Thank you for your order! Here are the details:

Order Number: {{order_number}}
Order Date: {{order_date}}
Estimated Delivery: {{estimated_delivery}}

SHIPPING ADDRESS:
{{shipping_address}}

ITEMS ORDERED:
{{items_list}}

ORDER SUMMARY:
Subtotal: {{subtotal}}
Shipping: {{shipping}}
Tax: {{tax}}
Total: {{order_total}}

Payment Method: {{payment_method}}

We'll send you tracking information once your order ships.

Best regards,
ShopHub Team
```

4. Save the template and note the **Template ID**

#### Step 4: Update Your Code
1. Open `script.js`
2. Find the `sendOrderConfirmationEmail` function
3. Replace these values:
   ```javascript
   const EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = 'your_service_id_here';
   const EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID = 'your_template_id_here';
   const EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your_public_key_here';
   ```

#### Step 5: Get Your IDs
- **Service ID**: Found in "Email Services" section
- **Template ID**: Found in "Email Templates" section  
- **Public Key**: Found in "API Keys" section

#### Step 6: Test
1. Place a test order on your website
2. Check if you receive the confirmation email
3. Check browser console for any errors

### Option 2: Backend Email Service (Advanced)

For a production store, consider:

#### Professional Email Services:
- **SendGrid** (reliable, 100 emails/day free)
- **Mailgun** (good for developers)
- **Amazon SES** (very cheap)
- **Postmark** (excellent deliverability)

#### Requirements:
- Backend server (Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.)
- API integration
- Email templates
- Error handling

### Option 3: Contact Form to Email (Simple Alternative)

If emails are too complex, you can:
1. Send order details to your email address
2. Manually send confirmation to customers
3. Use the existing contact form functionality
